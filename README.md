# Speed-Indicating-Helmet-Phase-2

Over-speeding and delayed accident responses are two major contributors to road fatalities among two-wheeler riders. Traditional helmets lack proactive feedback or emergency handling capabilities. CrashLite addresses this by introducing a smart helmet system that visually warns riders when they exceed speed limits and initiates emergency alerts in case of a crash.

The system consists of:

Helmet Unit: Flashes an LED inside the helmet based on overspeed severity (1â€“3 blinks).

Bike Unit: Detects crashes via an MPU6050 sensor and acts as a local server.

Mobile App: Tracks GPS speed, compares with Google Maps data, and handles emergency notifications.

CrashLite offers a non-distracting, reliable, and scalable safety solution, especially for students, commuters, delivery riders, and rental platforms aiming to promote safer road behavior and faster emergency responses.
